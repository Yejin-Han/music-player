		lyrics: 'This place<br>Why would anybody wanna stay?<br>Out of all the choices you could make<br>You chose to spend your days<br>Riding these trains and subways<br>Yeah I know<br>Just exactly what you would say<br>I wouldn’t understand what makes it great<br>But my dear, I’m so sad to say<br>That I can’t wait to leave this place<br><br>When there is no where else for you to go<br>Don’t call on me<br>These streets and empty bars will guide you home<br><br>Cause I know just what it means to leave<br>Tell me when you go to sleep<br>Do you ever think of me?<br>Don’t you ever wish you weren’t alone?<br><br>Some days<br>I still wonder if we’ll meet again<br>And would we hit it off or just pretend<br>Like we were hardly friends<br>A one night stand on a long weekend?<br>Yeah I know<br>Just exactly what you would say<br>Play it off like everything is great<br>Confuse this all for fate<br>Like stars have never aligned so straight<br><br>But I know this was never meant to be<br>Tell me when you go to sleep<br>Do you ever dream of me?<br>Don’t you ever wish you weren’t alone?'
